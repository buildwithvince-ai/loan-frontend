/**
 * Maps a failed public application submit into the result screen the 5 loan
 * forms render.
 *
 * Why this exists: the backend rejects oversized / over-count uploads at the
 * multer gate, BEFORE the route handler runs. It answers 400
 * `{ status:'error', message:'A file exceeds the NMB size limit.' }` — but the
 * browser cannot always READ that body. Multer replies while the browser is
 * still streaming the request, so Node resets the socket and `res.json()` /
 * `res.text()` throws on a truncated body. That is how three AKAP applications
 * on 2026-09-07 surfaced only "The server rejected the request (error 400).
 * Nothing was saved — please try again." The server did explain itself; the
 * client never got to read the explanation.
 *
 * So every branch here degrades gracefully: use the server's message when it
 * arrives, otherwise reconstruct a useful one from the status code plus what
 * the client already knows about the files it attached.
